# Real-Time Ray Tracing Project with C++ and ShaderToy

## Overview

This project is a real-time ray tracing implementation written in C++ using the ShaderToy tool. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities of real-time ray tracing and provide a visual demonstration of various rendering techniques.

**Note:** Accessing the project might cause browser lag due to the computational intensity of real-time ray tracing.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Ray Tracing:** The project utilizes the power of ray tracing to simulate realistic lighting, reflections, and shadows in real-time.

2. **ShaderToy Integration:** The project is hosted on ShaderToy, a platform for creating and sharing shader-based graphics. This allows for easy access and sharing within the ShaderToy community.

3. **Interactive Controls:** Experiment with different parameters and settings using the interactive controls provided in the ShaderToy interface.

4. **Camera Controls:**
   - **Mouse Interaction:** Rotate the view around a fixed point by moving the mouse.
   - **Keyboard (WASD):** Move the camera forward (W), backward (S), and sideways (A and D).

## Getting Started

To explore the real-time ray tracing project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project link: [Real-Time Ray Tracing](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cljczc) in your web browser.

2. Use the ShaderToy interface to adjust parameters and explore the visual effects in real-time.

**Note:** Depending on the complexity of the scene and your hardware, the project may cause the browser to lag. Consider adjusting settings or running the project on a powerful machine for a smoother experience.

## Controls

The ShaderToy interface provides various controls for interacting with the real-time ray tracing scene. Experiment with the following:

- **Mouse Interaction:** Rotate the view around a fixed point.
- **Keyboard (WASD):** Move the camera forward (W), backward (S), and sideways (A and D).
- **Shader Parameters:** Adjust shader parameters using the sliders and input fields provided in the ShaderToy interface.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** Toggle fullscreen mode for an immersive experience.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the project, experiment with the code, and contribute improvements. If you discover a bug or have suggestions, please create an issue on the ShaderToy platform.

## License
